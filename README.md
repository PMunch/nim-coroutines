This library was created based on
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine#Comparison_with_generators, it is in no
way shape or form intended to be a complete coroutine library and was created
mostly as a fun experiment. However if someone finds this useful and wants to
extend it I'm all for it, fire away with pull-requests.
